# 📚 zenn-books

**zenn-books** is a GitHub repository that centrally manages  
technical books published on **Zenn**, focusing on:

- Control engineering
- Semiconductor devices & processes
- AI-assisted system architecture (AITL)

All materials are written and structured from the perspective of  
**real-world engineering, system design, and technical education**.

## 🚀 Publishing Workflow (Zenn)

- Each book is managed under `books/*/` or `done-books/*/`
- `config.yaml` defines chapter order
- Subdirectories are not allowed (Zenn specification)
- Images are referenced from `assets/`

GitHub is used as the **editing and version-control environment**,  
while Zenn serves as the **public publishing platform**.

## 📊 Analytics & Design Feedback

Access analytics (Google Analytics 4) are used to:

- Observe international readership of English technical content
- Validate information architecture and language choices
- Understand how technical topics propagate globally

This is **not for marketing**,  
but for **engineering-oriented feedback and design validation**.
